                                <p>
                                    Abigail is originally from New Jersey where her initial career path was in teaching.
                                    She subsequently moved to Arizona and went to nursing school where she practiced as
                                    a nurse for 10 years before completing her nurse practitioner program.
                                </p>

                                    <p>
                                        She has been a part of Valley Internal Medicine and Pediatrics since completing
                                        her nurse practitioner program. She sees all aspects of general medical care for
                                        all age groups including well-woman care. In addition, she is undergoing
                                        additional training as a behavioral health practitioner -- an additional way
                                        that she can treat the "whole" person.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        Her free time is taken up with raising her 4 children with the help of her
                                        husband -- Steve -- who is the director of finance for a large company in town.
                                        She loves to keep active by running and going to the gym. If she has additional
                                        free time, it is happily spent inside of a book. The part of her career she
                                        enjoys the most is creating trusting relationships with her patients where she
                                        and her patients can work as a team to optimize health.
